WhatsApp Cloud API vs MM Lite API – Usage in Application

Your application will integrate both Meta’s WhatsApp Cloud API and MM Lite API, each optimized for specific business use cases:
WhatsApp Cloud API

    Where to use:

        Two-way chat/inbox with customers (support, sales, agent handover)

        AI Bot/ChatGPT conversations (interactive automation)

        Transactional messages (order alerts, OTPs, status updates)

        Contact-level or personalized communication (with expected replies)

    Key features enabled:

        Full chat session (24hr window), real-time inbox, delivery/read status, live assignment to agents

MM Lite API

    Where to use:

        Bulk/one-way marketing campaigns (offers, announcements, newsletters)

        Large-scale, high-throughput messaging (scheduled, recurring, high-volume blasts)

        Cost-sensitive use cases with no need for reply handling

    Key features enabled:

        Mass message delivery via pre-approved templates, campaign management, reporting, built-in delivery/retry by Meta

In the UI:

    When a user creates a campaign, they can choose “Cloud API” (for chat/transactional/support flows) or “MM Lite” (for marketing/bulk).

    Inbox, chatbox, and any two-way flows will use Cloud API.

    Bulk marketing and newsletter modules will use MM Lite API for scale and cost efficiency.
