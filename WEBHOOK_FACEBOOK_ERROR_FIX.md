# Fix Facebook Webhook Verification Error

## The Error You're Seeing
"The callback URL or verify token couldn't be validated"

This happens when Facebook tries to verify your webhook but the verify token doesn't match.

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: In WhatsWay
1. Go to Settings → Webhooks tab
2. Click "Save Webhook Configuration"
3. Select your WhatsApp channel
4. You'll see your webhook URL (copy this)
5. Enter a verify token (example: `my-secure-token-12345`)
6. **DON'T SAVE YET!**

### Step 2: In Facebook Business Manager
1. Go to your WhatsApp app configuration
2. Navigate to Configuration → Webhooks
3. In "Callback URL" paste: `https://your-domain.replit.app/webhook/[channel-id]`
4. In "Verify token" enter: `my-secure-token-12345` (MUST BE EXACT SAME)
5. Click "Verify and save"

### Step 3: Back in WhatsWay
1. NOW click "Save Webhook" in WhatsWay
2. The webhook should be configured successfully

## Important Notes

1. **Timing matters**: Facebook needs the verify token to be saved in WhatsWay BEFORE it tries to verify
2. **Exact match**: The verify token must be EXACTLY the same in both places (case-sensitive)
3. **Use your actual webhook URL**: Make sure you're using the URL with your channel ID, not the placeholder

## Your Webhook URLs

Based on your setup, your webhook URL should be:
```
https://d6a63d6e-5577-4d02-80b7-0b54ffbd5ab5-00-3ci9wfzjd76hb.worf.replit.dev/webhook/d420e261-9c12-4cee-9d65-253c8f7b9876
```

## What Happens During Verification

1. Facebook sends a GET request to your webhook URL with:
   - `hub.mode=subscribe`
   - `hub.verify_token=your-token`
   - `hub.challenge=random-string`

2. WhatsWay checks if the verify token matches
3. If it matches, WhatsWay responds with the challenge string
4. Facebook confirms the webhook is verified

## Still Not Working?

Try this order:
1. Save the webhook configuration in WhatsWay FIRST
2. Then go to Facebook and enter the URL and token
3. Click verify in Facebook

The key is making sure WhatsWay knows about the verify token before Facebook tries to verify it!
